# Dev.Notes

💡 Take quick, powerful dev notes—right from your VS Code sidebar.

📝 Auto-saved and synced every time you close your editor. 

### TODO
[] Ability to delete a single note (I know simple feature that should already be there!)
[] Integration with git so notes can be filtered by project/repo 
[] Unit tests
