💡 Take quick, powerful dev notes—right from your VS Code sidebar.

📝 Auto-saved and synced every time you close your editor.

### TODO

- [ ] Ability to delete a single note (I know simple feature that should already be there!)
- [ ] Integration with git so notes can be filtered by project/repo
- [ ] Unit tests
